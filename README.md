# DeepLearning
Deep Learning Coursework for software, systems and applications 3rd year module

## Objective 
- Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, create a NN model capable of generating an image of a pegasus
- An intentionally ill-defined learning problem; the generative model needs to use what it learns about birds and horses in order to produce the pegasus image

## To-Do
- [ ] Lecture catchup (especially lecture 4)
- [ ] Research generative architectures, produce list of papers / interesting articles etc.
- [ ] Select a generative model to use
- [ ] Train data on model
- [ ] Generate pegasus image
- [ ] Tweak and refine hyperparameters etc., keep track of results and details of improvements
- [ ] Write report
  - [ ] Diagram of model, dicussions on its design **(40 marks)**
  - [ ] Include best output **(40 marks)** 
  - [ ] Include batch of 64 images **(20 marks)**
