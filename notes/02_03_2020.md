# Notes 02/03/2020
- Produced results seen in dcgan2, output looks pretty shite but is atleast in a suitable structure
- Gonna copy output structure from example_dense_net.py
- Reduced learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0002 as per DCGAN paper suggestion
- Looked into switching ConvTranspose2D to Upsampling layer + Conv layer but that seems kinda dumb to me
- Switched to tanh on generator output layer as per DCGAN paper
