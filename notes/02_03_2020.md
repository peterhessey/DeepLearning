# Notes 02/03/2020
- Produced results seen in dcgan2, output looks pretty shite but is atleast in a suitable structure
- Gonna copy output structure from example_dense_net.py (maybe)
- Looked into switching ConvTranspose2D to Upsampling layer + Conv layer but that seems kinda dumb to me

## Changes 
- Switched to tanh on generator output layer as per DCGAN paper
- Reduced learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0002 as per DCGAN paper suggestion
  - These two changes yielded a reduction in checkerboarding and slightly more varied results
  - Still just coloured blobs dog-shit though

- Updated beta values for Adam:
  - Helped reduce garbage results, could even nearly see some horses!

### Balancing D/G
- Explained in [this](https://julianzaidi.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/deep-convolution-gan-dcgan-architecture-and-training/) article
- Basically train the discriminitor multiple times for each time we trian the generator
