# Notes 03/03/2020

- Watched the facebook AI video and got some good ideas
- Today I am planning on attempting:
  - [ ] Normalise images
  - [ ] Label flipping
    - Either do fixed or with a certain probability
    - [x] Fixed
  - [ ] Look into using spherical noise generation
  - [ ] Using LeaklyReLU for both D and G!
  - [ ] Tweaking the DG_ratio again once I've done all of this
